# Todo list

All this is a random hack out of boredom while in covid iso so dunno that I'll get to much of this.

## Basic functionality

* Larger (resizeable? full-page?) work grid area
* Actual layout
* Renderer automatically takes the smallest area containing emoji
* Take emoji list from a file (probably ok for now - integrating with slack API directly probably too complicated auth-wise for this revision)
* Allow configuring what the blank emoji is
* Re-work tool palette to be scrollable and searchable
* Basic UI theming, add a real title and favicon lol

## Additional functionality
* Creating and using multi-emoji stamps from a stamp toolbox
* Some means of persisting stamps
* Some means of persisting, returning to, sharing grid designs
* Dynamically get emoji from slack (per workspace? somehow?)

## QoL
* Toggle for click-to-place vs drag-to-place
* Import from slack copy-paste to grid
